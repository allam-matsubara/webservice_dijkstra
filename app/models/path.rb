  # This method is intended to get as entry a graph, which is not a real

  # Dijkstra's algorithm to find optimal paths even in large graphs. Other 
  # algorithm options could be used like Bellman-Ford, but for this case, 
  # Dijsktra's solves our problem. To use this we need to make some assumptions, 
  # like, the graph can't have edges with negative weight(in the context of 
  # this problem it makes no sense to have such thing) and it have no direction,
  # meaning that edges works in both directions from node A to B and from B 
  # to A. The return value is either a Struct::Vertex object containing the 
  # path and wight of the shortest path, or nil, in case if it doesn't. Nil 
  # will be returned in case of diconnected graphs, and the origin and 
  # destination nodes are in different connected components.
